# wui-components

> ## ðŸ›  Status: Work in progress
> Idea is to create composite web components which would be used by
> the developers in order to avoid creation of UI components. 
> Collection of UI components which can be integrated by developers in 
> applications which are framework agnostic i.e. the components can be 
> used in any framework(although we need to add a HOC for the
> management of lifecycle) without the hassle of creating components 
> from scratch.
